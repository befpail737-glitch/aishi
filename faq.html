                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Aishi capacitors' operational life depends on applied voltage, ambient temperature, and ripple current. The general rule is that life doubles for every 10°C decrease in operating temperature. We recommend using Aishi's lifetime calculation tools or contacting our FAE team to determine expected operational life under your specific application conditions.</p>
